                <h3>History and Development</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Early Calculating Devices</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The concept of calculation tools dates back thousands of years. Ancient devices such as the abacus were used by 
                    early civilizations for basic arithmetic. Later, the mechanical calculator was invented in the 17th century by
                    figures like Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. These devices were the precursors to the more 
                    sophisticated calculators we have today.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Electronic Calculators</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first electronic calculators appeared in the mid-20th century. In the 1960s, the advent of semiconductor 
                    technology allowed for the development of portable electronic calculators, which were smaller, faster, and more 
                    accurate than their mechanical predecessors. The invention of the integrated circuit (IC) in the 1960s
                    revolutionized the design of calculators, making them cheaper to produce and more reliable. In the 1970s, 
                    companies like Texas Instruments and Hewlett-Packard began producing the first commercially successful
                    pocket-sized calculators.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Modern Calculators</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Today, calculators are widely available, both as physical devices and software on computers, smartphones, and 
                    other devices. Many of them are highly specialized for different fields, and their functions have expanded to 
                    include statistical analysis, matrix operations, and even symbolic computation.
